## Introduction

The following document acts as an extension to the existing official [Infraction Procedure Guide (IPG)](https://blogs.magicjudges.org/rules/ipg/) to assist Judges who are working at Competitive or Professional Rules Enforcement Level in competitive commander (cEDH) Tournaments in the UK. This document is written as a supplement to the Infraction Procedure Guide and should be used in close conjunction with it and the [Multiplayer Addendum to the Magic Tournament Rules](/mtr). The goal of this document is to provide judges with a consistent approach to handle various situations and their infractions, where appropriate, for cEDH. Much like the official IPG any deviations from the state infraction or remedies should only be taken by the head judge of the event.

This document is an extension of the Infraction Procedure Guide, and therefore a person using it should first be familiar with that document. Once a person has reviewed the relevant sections of the Infraction Procedure Guide, they can turn to the this document to find details on how to proceed in Multiplayer Tournaments.

The sections below should be treated as additions to the existing IPG rather than replacing it unless otherwise specified.

## IPG 1 - General Philosophy

### 1.1 Definitions of Penalties

[Original](http://blogs.magicjudges.org/rules/ipg1-1/)

In Multiplayer Tournaments, in some cases the penalty or additional remedy of Skipping a Turn is applied. Please refer to the [Comprehensive Rules 500.10](https://blogs.magicjudges.org/rules/cr500/) for details on how Skipping a Turn works.

## IPG 2 - Game Play Errors

### 2.1 Missed Trigger

[Original](http://blogs.magicjudges.org/rules/ipg2-1/)

*Modification*: For the decision to put the missed trigger on the stack the trigger's controller's opponents decide "yes" or "no", in priority order, and the trigger is only placed on the stack if at least 1 opponent decides "yes".

### 2.3 Hidden Card Error

[Original](http://blogs.magicjudges.org/rules/ipg2-3/)

*Modification*: The opponent furthest in turn order from the active player who is not the infracting player is the opponent as described in the IPG. The erroneous set is revealed only to them, and they make any choices required for the remedy. The player making the decisions may not discuss choices with the other players involved.

## IPG 3 - Tournament Errors

### 3.1 Tardiness

[Original](http://blogs.magicjudges.org/rules/ipg3-1/)

*Modification*: Penalty changed to Turn Skip. Upgrades to a Match Loss as normal if the player is not in their seat 10 minutes into the round.

### 3.2 Outside Assistance

[Original](http://blogs.magicjudges.org/rules/ipg3-2/)

*Modification*: A player refers to any of the players actively playing the current game and may offer advice or strategic information within the current game. Any player who is eliminated from the current game is considered a spectator and may not offer advice or strategic information.

## IPG 4 - Unsporting Conduct

### 4.1 Minor

[Original](http://blogs.magicjudges.org/rules/ipg4-1/)

Additional actions which are considered Unsporting Conduct Minor:

* A player coerces an opponent into performing an action so they get priority back, such as by saying "Tap a land for mana so I get priority back and I'll interact or we'll lose the game". This is often known as mana bullying.
* A player uses coercive language to convince an opponent into intentionally drawing the game, such as by saying "If you donâ€™t want to Draw, then I will cast Silence and you lose to Bob" or "You have to accept the Draw, or else we will kill you and we Draw anyway". For more examples see [Unsporting Conduct in the MTR](/mtr/#54-unsporting-conduct).

### 4.2 Major

[Original](http://blogs.magicjudges.org/rules/ipg4-2/)

Additional actions which are considered Unsporting Conduct Major:

* Colluding with an opponent is also an Unsporting Conduct - Major infraction. Misplays or suboptimal plays are not Collusion, Collusion require intent to do so. For examples see [Unsporting Conduct in the MTR](/mtr/#54-unsporting-conduct).
* Performing a Spite Play against an opponent is also an Unsporting Conduct - Major infraction. Misplays or suboptimal plays are not Spite plays, Spite plays require intent to do so. For examples see [Unsporting Conduct in the MTR](/mtr/#54-unsporting-conduct).

If it is determined that players in Collusion with each other were aware that what they were doing was not permitted, or they acted with malicious intent, the infraction is [Unsporting Conduct - Cheating](https://blogs.magicjudges.org/rules/ipg4-8/). All players found in Collusion will have this infraction.

If it is determined that a player performed a Spite Play while aware it was not permitted, or they acted with malicious intent, the infraction is [Unsporting Conduct - Cheating](https://blogs.magicjudges.org/rules/ipg4-8/).
