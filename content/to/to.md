## Introduction

The following document is to be used in conjunction with the official cEDH UK Ruleset to assist in the organising and running of cEDH events that are run in partnership with cEDH UK.
This will ensure events are run with consistency to show unification of the circuit throughout the UK. Thank you for taking the time to read this document and for contributing to the UK’s growing cEDH circuit

## Event Scheduling

Events can be scheduled at a frequency and on a day that best suits the store however it is advised co-ordinating with Ben to avoid local clashes which may affect event attendance. Event frequencies of every 2-3 months are most popular. Once a date is secured it will be scheduled on the cEDH UK discord server which is linked to [this calendar](https://cedh.uk/calendar/).

An event thread within event discussion will also be created for players to discuss the upcoming event and ask any questions.

When announcing the event we do request cEDH UK is mentioned and we will also share our logo with you to place onto any promotional images.

## Event Prizing

Prizing for events will always vary from store to store. Unless offering a higher top end prize such as a Dual Land, the most popular is store credit split among the top players. This encourages reinvestment into the store, especially if the store has singles on offer. Traditionally sealed products aren’t favoured as much. For further prizing breakdown advice please contact Ben.

## Event Pricing

Every store has different overheads. Certain stores can run multiple events on the same day whereas others would be dedicating their whole play space to an event for the day. Event entry without Dual Lands as prizing ranges from £10-20 with heavier prizing events ranging from £20-£40. To discuss potential pricing compared to prizing please contact Ben.

## Event Software

We have a Topdeck.gg account to use. Once details for your first event are finalised the login will be shared and a tutorial can be arranged however its very user friendly!

## Event Photos

If any photos are taken please forward them onto Ben to share on our social medias.

## On the day of the event

When checking a player in for the event on TopDeck, make sure they have their decklist submitted. As a growing format not all events are ran with a judge but are overseen by the store owner or a member of the community. Below are the important points to announce in the player briefing at the start of the event.
